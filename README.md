## Introduction

This project delves into the intricate perceptions surrounding the wealth elite in the United States, exploring the nuanced debate over their role in society. Amidst increasing wealth and income inequality, this research seeks to uncover public sentiments towards the wealthiest individuals—examining both the admiration for their success and the resentment stemming from their influence on economic disparities. Through a multifaceted analysis combining data from social media, news outlets, and web sources, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of how the wealth elite are perceived and the implications this has for policy and societal norms.

## Data and Methodology

The project employs a variety of data collection and analysis techniques to capture the complex landscape of public perception:

- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Utilizing Python notebooks, we extract and clean data from diverse sources, including Twitter, News APIs, and web scraping.
- **Clustering**: Identifying patterns and segments within the data to categorize public sentiment.
- **Association Rule Mining & LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**: Discovering underlying themes and associations in the discourse surrounding the wealth elite.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Leveraging Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, SVMs (Support Vector Machines), and Neural Networks to predict sentiment trends and extract insights.

### Files and Notebooks

- `Data Collection and Preparation.ipynb`: Code for initial data gathering and cleaning processes.
- `Data -NewsAPI.ipynb`, `Data-Twitter.ipynb`, `Data_Web-Scrapped.ipynb`: Notebooks dedicated to specific data sources.
- `Clustering Data.ipynb`, `Association Rule Mining Code.Rmd`, `Decision Tree & Neural Network.ipynb`, etc.: Analysis and machine learning models applied to the dataset.

## Insights and Conclusions

Our findings reveal a divided perception of the wealth elite, influenced by factors such as media portrayal, political rhetoric, and individual actions of wealthy figures. While some are viewed as pillars of innovation and philanthropy, others are criticized for practices perceived as exploitative. This dichotomy underscores the complexity of public sentiment and highlights the need for nuanced discourse and policy aimed at addressing wealth inequality.
